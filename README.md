# Elasticsearch-Filebeat-Kibana stack to monitor Nginx logs

## Contents
Nginx: containing build image nginx web server
Elasticsearch: containing build image and configuration for Elasticsearch
Filebeat: containing build image and configuration for Filebeat to stream nginx logs Elasticsearch
Kibana: containing build image and configure for Kibana to visualize data from an Elasticsearch index

## How it works

Nginx access and error logs are written to a directory. The directory is mapped to a local volume.
Filebeat reads the nginx logs from the local volume and sends it to an Elasticsearch index [filebeat-*].
Kibana uses the index to visualize the access and the error logs.

## How to run it
